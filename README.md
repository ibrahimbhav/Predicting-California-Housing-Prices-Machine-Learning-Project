# Predicting-California-Housing-Prices-Machine-Learning-Project
This project uses machine learning to analyze census data and predict future housing prices in California. The project aims to provide insights into the housing market and help people make informed decisions about buying and selling houses. Throughout this project I fetch, analyze, process, and clean the data by using custom built transformers and also built in trasnformers from the sklearn libraries. I also train and fit the data to be able to make accurate predictions usingLinReg model, then a DecisionTree model and then lastly a RandomForestRegressor Model which proved to work the best. I then measure the accuracy of the RFR model using a RMSE statistic. Lastly I finetun the hyper parameters using sklearn's library GridSearchCV and make a 95% CI to make a genearlization error
